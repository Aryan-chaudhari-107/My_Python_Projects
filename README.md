üß† 100 DAYS OF CODE ‚Äì PYTHON PROJECTS

‚û°Ô∏è This repository contains all the projects I built while following the 
    100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

‚û°Ô∏è Around 70% of the projects were built independently by me ‚Äî from planning 
    to implementation. While I didn‚Äôt rely on the course materials for these, 
    I occasionally used debugging tools, Stack Overflow, and Google to solve 
    issues or clarify errors ‚Äî just like in real-world coding.

‚û°Ô∏è For the remaining 30% of the projects, I needed some guidance from course 
    content or other sources when facing more complex problems. In those cases, 
    the effort split was typically around 60‚Äì40 or 50‚Äì50, but I always ensured 
    I fully understood and rewrote the code myself.

‚û°Ô∏è Throughout this journey, my focus was on learning through real problem-solving, 
    not just completing assignments. I took the time to understand every line of code, 
    and often customized or extended the projects beyond what was taught.

‚û°Ô∏è Every project in this repository was written, tested, and debugged by me.
    Feedback, suggestions, or ideas are always welcome ‚Äî I‚Äôm continuously improving!
