# ðŸ§  100 DAYS OF CODE - PYTHON PROJECTS

This repository contains all the projects I built while following the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

--------------------

### ðŸš€ OVERVIEW

âž¤ **70% of the projects** were built independently by me â€” from planning to implementation.  
While I didnâ€™t rely on the course material for these, I occasionally used **debugging tools**, **Stack Overflow**, and **Google** to troubleshoot issues â€” just like in real-world coding.

âž¤ For the remaining **30%**, I referred to course content or other external resources when tackling more complex problems.  
In these cases, the contribution split was typically around **60â€“40** or **50â€“50**, but I always ensured I **understood**, **modified**, and **rewrote** the code in my own way.

âž¤ My goal throughout this journey was **learning through real problem-solving**, not just completing assignments.  
I focused on understanding every line of code, often extending or customizing the projects beyond what was taught.
